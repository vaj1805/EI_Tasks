USE CASE:
A document processing application needs to create different types of documents (e.g., Word, PDF). 
The main application shouldn't be tightly coupled to the concrete document classes.

PATTERN PURPOSE:
The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide 
which class to instantiate.
