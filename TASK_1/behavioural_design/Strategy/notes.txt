Use Case: An e-commerce application needs to process payments. 
The user can choose to pay 
via Credit Card or PayPal at checkout. 
The payment algorithm should be selectable at runtime.

Pattern Purpose: The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, 
encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. 
It lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.
