Use Case: A news agency publishes stories. Multiple news channels (subscribers) need to be notified 
automatically whenever a new story is published.

Pattern Purpose: The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. 
When one object (the subject) changes state, all its dependents (observers) are 
notified and updated automatically.
