Use Case: You're building a coffee shop application. 
A basic coffee can be dynamically "decorated" with extra options like milk or sugar, 
each adding to the cost and description.

Pattern Purpose: The Decorator pattern allows you to attach 
new behaviors to objects dynamically by placing them inside special "wrapper" objects 
that contain the behaviors.
